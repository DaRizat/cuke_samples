Feature: Course Page
As a user
In order to access many courses quickly and easily
I would like to be able to visit a courses page which gives me robust course finding tools

Scenario: User can view a list of new courses
Scenario: User can view a list of trending paid courses
Scenario: User can view various categorical course lists
Scenario: User can access sidebar links to show all courses of a given category (?)
Scenario: Courses are presented to the user in a thumbnail view including title and price, with a tool tip hover containing more details and a buy link

Feature: QA Feed
As a Logged in User
In order to follow and participate in Q&A discussions I have subscribed to
I would like to have a Q&A feed that aggregates these discussions for me

Scenario: Logged in User can access a Q&A Forum Guide which details the use of the forum
Scenario: Logged in User is presented with a vertically scrolling chronological list of Q&A discussions they have subscribed to
Scenario: Logged in User can access a list of unanswered questions via toggle button at the top of the feed
Scenario: Logged in User can find their friends by linking to Facebook (Why is this only here?)
